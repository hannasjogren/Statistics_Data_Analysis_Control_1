This project analyzes employee turnover data to identify patterns and provide recommendations to reduce attrition. Key factors like satisfaction, salary, working hours and promotions are examined.

Key Insights:

Employees with low satisfaction levels are more likely to leave the company.
Turnover rates are higher among lower salary groups.
Employees who work either too many or too few hours per month tend to leave more frequently.
Employees handling more than five projects are more likely to leave, possibly due to workload stress.
Employees who have not been promoted in five years tend to leave more often.
Workplace accidents do not show a strong correlation with turnover.

Recommendations:

Implement initiatives to improve employee satisfaction, such as feedback mechanisms and work-life balance programs.
Review salary distribution to ensure competitive wages.
Optimize workload by limiting the number of projects per employee.
Evaluate promotion policies to encourage long-term commitment.
Continue monitoring and minimizing workplace accidents, even though their direct impact on turnover is minimal.
